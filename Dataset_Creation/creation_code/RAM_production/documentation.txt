Dataset Generation Script Documentation
=======================================

This document provides an overview of the `generate_all_datasets.py` script, its functions for generating different time series datasets with anomalies, and the logging format used.

Output Directory

All generated dataset CSV files and this documentation are stored in:
`/home/kai/Documents/TSAD/TSAD_Seminar/Dataset_Creation/prelim_datasets`

Script Overview
---------------
The script `generate_all_datasets.py` is designed to produce multiple datasets, each simulating a system under different workloads and anomaly conditions. The primary metric monitored and logged is RAM usage.

Key components:
- A main `run_workload_loop` function that handles the core logic for each dataset generation process, including timing, workload scheduling (normal and anomaly), and invoking matrix operations.
- A `perform_matrix_operation` function that executes NumPy matrix multiplications and normalizations to consume RAM and CPU.
- A multi-threaded logging system: Each dataset generator spawns its own `continuous_logger_thread` that periodically records the system's state and RAM usage to a dedicated CSV file. Log entries are timestamped.
- Global state management (`THREAD_STATES`) to coordinate between main workload threads and their respective logger threads.

Dataset Generation Functions
----------------------------

Each `generate_dataset_X` function configures and runs a workload loop for a specific scenario.

Common Parameters for Normal Operations (unless specified otherwise):
- Normal Matrix Sizes: `[3000, 3500, 4500, 5000]` (chosen randomly)
- Base Sleep Time between workloads: 4 seconds.
- Number of matrices created for normal workload operation: 3
- Number of matrix dot product operations per workload: 5

### Function 1: `generate_dataset_1()`
- **Description**: Generates dataset with high RAM usage anomalies.
- **Log File**: `dataset_1_ram_spike_log.csv`
- **Total Runtime**: 15 minutes.
- **Initial Normal Period**: First 3 minutes.
- **Anomaly Type**: High RAM usage. This is achieved by performing matrix calculations with a larger matrix size.
    - Anomaly Matrix Size: `[6000]` (chosen randomly if multiple were provided, here only one)
    - Number of matrices for anomaly operation: 4 (to further increase RAM impact)
- **Anomaly Trigger**: Randomly, with a 1 in 50 chance per workload cycle after the initial normal period.
- **Memory Preparation**: At the very start of this function, a single instance of the anomaly-sized matrix operation (6000x6000, 4 matrices) is run to prepare/pre-warm system memory.

### Function 2: `generate_dataset_2()`
- **Description**: Simulates an anomaly where the system becomes unresponsive or slow, characterized by an increased sleep time.
- **Log File**: `dataset_2_sleep_anomaly_log.csv`
- **Total Runtime**: 15 minutes.
- **Initial Normal Period**: First 3 minutes.
- **Anomaly Type**: Increased sleep duration.
    - During an anomaly event, the sleep timer is increased by 2 seconds (i.e., total 6 seconds of sleep instead of 4).
    - No matrix calculations are performed during the sleep anomaly period.
- **Anomaly Trigger**: Randomly, with a 1 in 50 chance per workload cycle after the initial normal period.
- **Memory Preparation**: None specific, as the anomaly is not primarily RAM-based.

### Function 3: `generate_dataset_3()`
- **Description**: Simulates an anomaly with a medium-sized matrix calculation, representing a moderate RAM increase.
- **Log File**: `dataset_3_medium_ram_spike_log.csv`
- **Total Runtime**: 15 minutes.
- **Initial Normal Period**: First 3 minutes.
- **Anomaly Type**: Medium RAM usage increase.
    - Anomaly Matrix Size: `[4000]`
    - Number of matrices for anomaly operation: 3 (standard)
- **Anomaly Trigger**: Randomly, with a 1 in 50 chance per workload cycle after the initial normal period.
- **Memory Preparation**: None specified by default (can be configured if needed).

### Function 4: `generate_dataset_4()`
- **Description**: A more complex scenario that combines all three previously described anomaly types. Only one anomaly type is selected at random when an anomaly event occurs. This function also has a longer runtime.
- **Log File**: `dataset_4_mixed_anomalies_log.csv`
- **Total Runtime**: 25 minutes.
- **Initial Normal Period**: First 6 minutes.
- **Anomaly Types (randomly chosen when an anomaly event occurs)**:
    1.  **High RAM Spike**: Matrix size `[6000]`, 4 matrices (like Function 1's anomaly).
    2.  **Increased Sleep**: Sleep time +2 seconds (like Function 2's anomaly), no matrix calculations during sleep.
    3.  **Medium RAM Spike**: Matrix size `[4000]`, 3 matrices (like Function 3's anomaly).
- **Anomaly Trigger**: Randomly, with a 1 in 150 chance per workload cycle after the initial normal period (range increased from 1-50 to 1-150 to maintain approximately the same anomaly occurrence frequency over its longer active period compared to a 1-in-50 trigger in shorter functions).
- **Memory Preparation**: At the very start of this function, a single instance of the high RAM spike anomaly (6000x6000 matrix size, 4 matrices) is run to prepare/pre-warm system memory.

Logging Format
--------------
Each dataset function generates a CSV log file with the following columns:

1.  `timestamp`: The date and time of the log entry (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`).
2.  `state`: The current operational state of the script generating the dataset. Examples:
    - `idle`: The script is between workloads (sleeping).
    - `working_normal`: Performing a standard workload.
    - `working_anomaly_ram_spike`: Performing a high RAM usage anomaly workload.
    - `working_anomaly_sleep`: In sleep anomaly state.
    - `working_anomaly_medium_ram_spike`: Performing a medium RAM usage anomaly workload.
    - `working_special_prep`: Performing initial memory preparation workload.
    - `ending_script`: The script is shutting down.
    - `error`: An error occurred within the logging thread itself.
3.  `event_type`: Describes the nature of the log entry. Examples:
    - `SCRIPT_START`: Marks the beginning of the dataset generation.
    - `SCRIPT_END`: Marks the end of the dataset generation.
    - `WORKLOAD_START`: Marks the beginning of a matrix operation workload or sleep anomaly.
    - `WORKLOAD_END`: Marks the completion of a matrix operation workload or sleep anomaly.
    - `SAMPLED_STATE`: A periodic log entry from the logger thread, capturing the current state and RAM usage.
    - `LOGGER_ERROR`: Indicates an error occurred within the logger thread trying to capture data.
4.  `event_details`: Provides specific details about the event. Examples:
    - For matrix workloads `WORKLOAD_START`/`WORKLOAD_END`: `type:[normal|anomaly_type],size:[matrix_size]`, and for `WORKLOAD_END`, also `duration:[seconds]s`.
    - For sleep anomalies: `type:anomaly_sleep_increase,sleep_time:[total_sleep_time]s`.
    - For `SCRIPT_START`/`SCRIPT_END`: Information about the dataset being generated.
    - For `LOGGER_ERROR`: Details about the logging error.
    - Empty for `SAMPLED_STATE` entries where RAM is the primary data.
5.  `ram_usage_mb`: System RAM usage by the script process in Megabytes (MB), recorded at the time of `SAMPLED_STATE` entries. For other event types, this field might be empty or not applicable.

How to Run
----------
Execute the `generate_all_datasets.py` script using a Python interpreter.
```bash
python Dataset_Creation/creation_code/generate_all_datasets.py
```
By default, the `main()` function in the script is configured to run all dataset generation functions sequentially.

Note on Concurrency
-------------------
While the logging for each dataset generator is threaded, the main `main()` function in the script calls each `generate_dataset_X()` function sequentially by default. If concurrent generation of multiple datasets is desired, the `main()` function would need to be modified to use threading or multiprocessing for the calls to `generate_dataset_X()` functions. However, running them sequentially is safer for system resource management, as each function can be resource-intensive.
