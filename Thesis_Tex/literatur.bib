abstract = {Software defined networking (SDN) has emerged as the integral part of cloud services since it provides flexible management capabilities to monitor and to analyze the network traffic with the help of programmable entities. Although, such functionalities play a significant role in terms of protecting the availability of cloud services against the security threats, SDN still has some vulnerabilities such as the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The DDoS attackers use spurious packets similar to normal ones and endanger the service continuity of SDN. Although conventional packet-based intrusion detection systems have broad databases to detect DDoS attacks, they are impotent of detection when the attack traffic is sheltered by the normal network traffic. The idea is therefore, to come up with a new countermeasure by observing and distinguishing the instant changes in network. In this work, we propose a DDoS attack detection and defense scheme using time-series analysis for SDN. The proposed scheme employs a model based on the upcoming traffic feature forecasting and the chaos theory together with the exponential filter and the dynamic threshold method to detect instant changes in the network. The experimental result shows that our algorithm has high detection rate and low false alarm.}

Many of the definitions explain ANN by referring to graphics instead of giving well explained mathematical definitions; therefore, misleading weighted graphs (as in minimum cost flow problem networks) fit the definition of ANN. This study aims to give a clear definition that will differentiate ANN and graphical networks by referring to biological neural networks. The proposed definition of ANN is a mathematical definition, from the point of graph theory which defines ANN as a directed graph. Then differences between ANNs and other networks will be explained by examples using proposed definition.}

      abstract = {Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task for time-series analytics with important implications for the downstream performance of many applications. In contrast to other domains where AD mainly focuses on point-based anomalies (i.e., outliers in standalone observations), AD for time series is also concerned with range-based anomalies (i.e., outliers spanning multiple observations). Nevertheless, it is common to use traditional point-based information retrieval measures, such as Precision, Recall, and F-score, to assess the quality of methods by thresholding the anomaly score to mark each point as an anomaly or not. However, mapping discrete labels into continuous data introduces unavoidable shortcomings, complicating the evaluation of range-based anomalies. Notably, the choice of evaluation measure may significantly bias the experimental outcome. Despite over six decades of attention, there has never been a large-scale systematic quantitative and qualitative analysis of time-series AD evaluation measures. This paper extensively evaluates quality measures for time-series AD to assess their robustness under noise, misalignments, and different anomaly cardinality ratios. Our results indicate that measures producing quality values independently of a threshold (i.e., AUC-ROC and AUC-PR) are more suitable for time-series AD. Motivated by this observation, we first extend the AUC-based measures to account for range-based anomalies. Then, we introduce a new family of parameter-free and threshold-independent measures, VUS (Volume Under the Surface), to evaluate methods while varying parameters. Our findings demonstrate that our four measures are significantly more robust in assessing the quality of time-series AD methods.},
